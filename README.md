Skills that I learned by doing this project:

* HTML: Basic HTML coding to stablish a standalone HTML page.
* CSS: Simple responsive coding, importing fonts, addressing "Classes" and "IDs" from HTML elements and also CSS Pseudo Classes like mouse "hover".
* JavaScript: Calling elements from HTML and CSS and using functions like "selectMediaStream" in order to choose which screen should be selected for sharing. Start button function to start sharing screens.
