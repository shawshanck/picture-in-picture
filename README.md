# picture-in-picture

Using JavaScript to share tabs and windows or entire screen in a format of "Picture in Picture"

* You can share screens while working on another window or screen.
* Fully resizeable.
* Easy to use.
* Compatible with Chrome.

Skills that I learned by doing this project:

* HTML: Basic HTML coding to stablish a standalone HTML page.
* CSS: Simple responsive coding, importing fonts, addressing "Classes" and "IDs" from HTML elements and also CSS Pseudo Classes like mouse "hover".
* JavaScript: Calling elements from HTML and CSS and using global chrome functions "selectMediaStream" in order to choose which screen should be selected for sharing.

I am learning from others and practicing projects to improve my skills and also sharing my experiences with people. I will study and learn more with encouragement I get from you.
